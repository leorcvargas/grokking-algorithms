# grokking-algorithms

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises in the book: Grokking Algorithms, by Aditya Y. Bhargava.

I'm going to commit changes to this repository as I progress through the book in my free time. For now all examples and usages are being described by the tests.

## Ideas for the future
- [ ] Make a visualizer for the algorithms
- [ ] Structure it as a library
- [ ] Create benchmark tests with interesting data
